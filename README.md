This is a CMS (Content Management System) Project From SCRATCH.
This System Operates on two different views.
A Users View and an Admin Panel.
At users view, users can see posts, categories and later on I will add a login system for all users as well.
But on the admin panel the admin can create posts,delete,update posts and comments and users also.He can Pretty much control the users view.
Comments made by users need the approval of the admin,otherwise the comments can not be displayed on users side.
